# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-ANFIS and WNN
Here we develop and apply a neural network (WNN) approach and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model which could take input of any data set and give a GUI based comparative analysis between ANN and ANFIS.The wavelet function used in the WNN analysis is mexican hat function.
